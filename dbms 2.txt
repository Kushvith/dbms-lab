2.  Consider the following schema for Order Database:
	SALESMAN(Salesman_id, Name, City, Commission)
	CUSTOMER(Customer_id, Cust_Name, City, Grade, Salesman_id)
	ORDERS(Ord_No, Purchase_Amt, Ord_Date, Customer_id,
	 Salesman_id)

create table salesman(
salesman_id integer primary key,
name varchar(30),
city varchar(30),
commission real);


create table customer(
customer_id integer primary key,
cust_name varchar(30),
city varchar(20),
grade integer,
salesman_id references salesman(salesman_id)
on delete cascade);


create table orders(
ord_no integer primary key,
purchase_amt integer,
ord_date date,
customer_id references customer(customer_id)
on delete cascade,
salesman_id references salesman(salesman_id)
on delete cascade);


insert into salesman values(1,'john','banglore','25%');
insert into salesman values(2,'ravi','manglore','20%');
insert into salesman values(3,'kumar','mysore','15%');
insert into salesman values(4,'smith','delhi','30%');
insert into salesman values(5,'harsha','hydrabad','25%');



insert into customer values(10,'preethi','banglore',100,1);
insert into customer values(11,'vivek','manglore',300,1);
insert into customer values(12,'bhaskar','chennai',400,2);
insert into customer values(13,'chethan','banglore',200,2);
insert into customer values(14,'mamatha','banglore',400,3);


insert into orders values(50,5000,'04-may-17',10,1);
insert into orders values(51,450,'20-jan-17',10,2);
insert into orders values(52,1000,'24-feb-17',13,2);
insert into orders values(53,3500,'13-apr-17',14,3);
insert into orders values(54,550,'09-mar-17',12,2);


1 count the customers with grades above banglore's average

select grade,count(distinct customer_id)
from customer
group by grade
having grade > (select avg(grade)
from customer
where city = 'banglore');

explaination average query returns the average 266.33
count returns the grade and total no records of single customer
grade should be greater than average
eg 300 > 266.3 true
	100 > 266.3 false

2 find the name and numbers of all salesman who had more than
one customer

	select salesman_id,name
	from salesman A
	where 1 < (select count(*) 
	from customer
	where salesman_id = A.salesman_id);

3. list all the salesman and indicate those who have and dont have
	customer in their cities (use union operation)

	select S.salesman_id,S.name,C.cust_name,S.commission from 
	salesman S,customer C
	where S.city = C.city
	union
	select salesman_id,name,'No match',commission
	from salesman
	where not city = ANY(select city from customer)
	order by 2 desc;

	note : any keyword is not working use not in keyword removing 
			any 
			remove not keyword from city

4 create view thats find the salesman who has the customer with the
	highest order of a day

	create view elitsalesman as
	select b.ord_date,A.salesman_id,A.name
	from salesman A, orders B
	where A.salesman_id = B.salesman_id
	and B.purchase_amt = (select max(purchase_amt)
	from orders c
	where c.ord_date = B.ord_date); 


5 demonstrate the delete operation by removing salesman with id 1000.
	all his orders must be deleted

	delete from salesman
	where salesman_id = 1;

	select* from salesman;
	select * from orders;
